# Progress Log

Chinese version: [progress.md](progress.md)

Last updated: 2026-03-13

## Current state

This repository already has a workable v1 foundation for a Polymarket trading system built around cloud execution, public web visibility, and hard service-side risk controls.

The monorepo currently includes:

- `apps/web`
  - spectator site and admin pages for Vercel
- `services/orchestrator`
  - scheduling, risk management, job orchestration, admin actions
- `services/executor`
  - Polymarket execution, sync flows, live ops
- `packages/contracts`
  - decision schemas and shared internal contracts
- `packages/db`
  - database schema, queries, seeds, and migrations
- `vendor`
  - pinned external repository manifest

## Implemented

### 1. Website

The public website already includes:

- overview page
- positions page
- trades page
- runs list page
- run detail page
- reports page
- backtests page

The admin surface already supports:

- `pause`
- `resume`
- `run-now`
- `cancel-open-orders`
- `flatten`

### 2. Data model

The database already includes the core tables:

- `agent_runs`
- `agent_decisions`
- `execution_events`
- `positions`
- `portfolio_snapshots`
- `risk_events`
- `resolution_checks`
- `artifacts`
- `system_state`

### 3. Backend foundation

The following base pieces are already in place:

- orchestrator service
- executor service
- shared contracts
- base risk logic
- vendor sync script
- database seed and query layer

### 4. Risk rules

The currently implemented hard rules are:

- per-position `30%` stop loss
- `20%` drawdown halt relative to portfolio high-water mark

### 5. Credential loading

The project can already auto-discover a sibling `.env.aizen` for local development against a real Polymarket wallet.

### 6. Live trading tools

The project already has:

- balance check scripts
- market and orderbook sanity checks
- a capped live trade script limited to `$1`

## Verified

The following items have already been verified:

- `pnpm typecheck`
- `pnpm test`
- `pnpm build`
- successful discovery of the real wallet env file at `../pm-PlaceOrder/.env.aizen`
- successful read of the real USDC balance
- successful submission of one live order below `$1`
- successful readback of the resulting position from Polymarket account data

## Most recent live trade

The latest small live test produced:

- market: `tur-kas-eyu-2026-03-15-kas`
- action: `BUY NO`
- requested notional: `$1`
- order status: `matched`
- order ID: `0x4ec470917138126104a097a3fdaa506d61860e15c1dad9c2d21bbaf5678f1921`

Readback position data:

- outcome: `No`
- size: `2.040815`
- average cost: `0.49`

## Fixes made during live testing

Several important issues were corrected during the live test workflow:

- CLOB authentication now tries `deriveApiKey()` before `createOrDeriveApiKey()`
- orderbook parsing now computes the true best bid and best ask instead of trusting array order
- market filtering now uses the more suitable `markets` endpoint for pre-screening
- live checks now support explicit `--slug` targeting for safer manual execution

## Remaining gaps

The main missing pieces are:

- Docker runtime validation has not been completed because Docker is not installed on this machine
- the full Claude Code production decision loop is not fully connected yet
- external vendor repositories are pinned, but many capabilities are not yet integrated into scheduled runtime flows
- Vercel deployment and cloud-host deployment are not done yet
- the OpenClaw runtime is still missing

## Next priorities

1. Connect the real Claude Code decision loop.
2. Integrate market pulse, backtesting, and resolution tracking into the orchestrator.
3. Replace sample display paths with real runtime data paths.
4. Deploy Postgres, Redis, orchestrator, and executor.
5. Deploy the web app to Vercel.
6. Run a longer dry-run before increasing real-money scope.
