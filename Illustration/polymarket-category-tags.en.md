# Polymarket Available Category Tags Reference

> Snapshot: 2026-03-31T04:22Z | Source: Polymarket Gamma API

## Data Source

These tags **come from the official Polymarket Gamma API** (`gamma-api.polymarket.com/events`), not invented by us.

How primary category is determined:
1. **Preferred**: `event.category` (official Polymarket category field)
2. **Fallback**: `event.tags[0]` (first official tag on the event)
3. In practice, most markets use the `first-tag` fallback path (Polymarket's `category` field is often empty)

The tags themselves are official Polymarket data. The "which tag becomes the primary category" logic is our code's decision (pick the first one).

## Usage

```bash
# Filter to a specific category
pnpm pulse:recommend -- --category <slug>

# Examples
pnpm pulse:recommend -- --category politics
pnpm pulse:recommend -- --category tech
pnpm pulse:recommend -- --category sports
```

## Type Weight Explanation

Type weight affects candidate ranking score (`score = log10(liquidity) * log10(volume24h) * typeWeight`).

| Weight | Categories | Meaning |
|--------|-----------|---------|
| **1.5x** | politics, geopolitics, tech, ai, elections, trump | AI has edge, long-horizon reasoning |
| **1.2x** | economics, finance, fed, fomc | AI has moderate edge |
| **1.0x** | sports, esports, culture | Baseline |
| **0.5x** | weather | Low AI edge |
| **0.3x** | crypto, bitcoin, ethereum | Near-zero AI edge (random walk) |
| **0.8x** | all others | Default weight |

## Notes

- Tradeable candidate counts change dynamically with Polymarket market activity. This table is a point-in-time snapshot.
- `--category` uses **exact match** on slug (case-sensitive).
- You can also use `--tag` to filter by tag (a market can have multiple tags but only one primary category).
